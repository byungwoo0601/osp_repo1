We're bananas about books at Kids' Book Review - and our list of reviews continues to grow rapidly, from board books to YA fiction. We have several thousand reviews on this site, with more added daily.

If you would like to source particular reviews, please use our search function at the top left of the site for book titles and authors/illustrators. If you are on a device, you will need to access the 'web version' of the site in order to do a search. Just scroll to the bottom of your screen to see the web version link.

We also offer Labels if you are searching for particular themes or genres, and a series of Book Lists.

You can see lesson plans/teaching notes for several books here but please note we are also unable to update this. Further teaching notes can be found on publisher websites or even author/illustrator websites. Google is your friend!

Please note that all book prices are shown in Australian dollars.

If you are looking to have a book reviewed, please see our POLICY.
